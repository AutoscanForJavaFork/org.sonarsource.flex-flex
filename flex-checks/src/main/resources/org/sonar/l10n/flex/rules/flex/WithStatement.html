<p>
Never use the with statements, since they decrease readability.
When you do not specify a variable's scope, you do not always know where you are setting properties, so your code can be confusing.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule :
</p>

<pre>
with (foo) { // Noncompliant
  return x;  // is it a property of foo or local variable ?
}

return foo.x; // Compliant
</pre>
