  Minimize the use of <code>onEnterFrame</code> event handlers, or at the very least install and remove them when necessary.
  This event handler will be continually invoked at the frame rate of the SWF file, whatever frame is on your movie or its timeline.</br>
  Having too many onEnterFrame handlers may drop performance significantly.
