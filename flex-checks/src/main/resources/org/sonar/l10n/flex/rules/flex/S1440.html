<p>
  The == and != operators do type coercion before comparing values, but === and !== don't. </br >
  This is bad because it can mask type errors. For example, it evaluates <code>' \t\r\n' == 0</code> as <code>true</code>, and <code>foo == null</code> as <code>true</code>, even if foo, in the last example, is <code>undefined</code>. </br >
  It is best to always use the side-effect-less === and !== operators instead.
